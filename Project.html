            <h1 id="whose">Founder Of Pakistan</h1>
            <p id="about1"><b>
                Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah</b> was a towering figure in the history of Pakistan. He was     born in Karachi in 1876 and went on to become the founding father of Pakistan.

                As a young lawyer, Jinnah was known for his sharp legal mind and his commitment to justice. He was one of the leading advocates in India, and his reputation was such that he was often referred to as the "best legal brain" in the country.
                
                However, Jinnah was also deeply committed to the idea of an independent Muslim state, separate from Hindu-dominated India. He spent much of his life working tirelessly to achieve this goal, even when it seemed impossible.
                
                In the end, Jinnah's perseverance paid off. On August 14th, 1947, Pakistan gained its independence from British colonial rule. Jinnah became the first Governor-General of Pakistan, and his vision of a separate Muslim state became a reality.
